# MOOC of game design

[Build a Game Using Unity 3D](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/game-development)  
This is a MOOC from the Michigan State University taught by Brian Winn and Casey O'Donnell.  
It is a specialization containing 5 courses in which you learn how to concretize your ideas of game.

Each week, there is one project to do : it can be a document or a game build.  
To launch a WebGL build, you need **Firefox**.
